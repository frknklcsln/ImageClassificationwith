# ImageClassificationwith
The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. This project aims to classify the input image as a dog or cat image. The image input you give to the system will be analyzed, and the estimated result will be output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image. To get the best parameters for the model, I will use the GridSearchCV method.
